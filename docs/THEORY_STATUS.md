# Theory and evidence status

| Claim | Status | Required next evidence |
|---|---|---|
| A decomposable normalized Slater state has a flat particle-cut Schmidt spectrum | proved in draft and numerically verified | External proof review and literature cross-check |
| Ordinary particle TT must pay the exchange-statistics Schmidt multiplicity | proved in draft and numerically verified | Stronger concise/full-support bounds remain open |
| Matrix-wedge FEMPS is associative and strictly antisymmetric | proved from exterior associativity; small-N verified | External algebra review |
| Generic nontrivial FEMPS has polynomial exact contraction | not established; known exact routes remain exponential/combinatorial | Hardness theorem or a new generic recurrence |
| Fixed-number Pfaffian/AGP FEMPS contracts polynomially | theorem/algorithm draft; value, gradient, scaling and GPU verified; the LC-AGP family and K-squared organization have direct prior art | Use as fallback/control, not central novelty |
| Finite-AGP overlap compression can be made term-gauge invariant | proved by unit-diagonal balancing; explicit exterior and three-seed D10 tests pass | Relation of the contribution Gram spectrum to physical correlation remains open |
| 2201 functional MPS baseline transfers to the current backend | validated by controlled `D`/`chi`/seed scan | Larger paper-figure digitization is optional |

Scalable contraction is asserted only for the fixed-number Pfaffian/AGP
subclass and finite sums, not for generic matrix-wedge FEMPS. No novelty claim
is currently asserted as fact.  The finite-AGP contribution Gram spectrum is a
gauge-invariant multiplicity diagnostic, not an entanglement spectrum. Phase 12
shows that the LC-AGP subclass is numerically systematic, but prior AGP-CI work
precludes treating that fact as the core FEMPS method contribution.
